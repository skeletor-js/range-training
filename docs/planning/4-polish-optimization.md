# Phase 4: Polish & Optimization

## Objective
Refine the user experience with "delight" features, deeper data insights, and technical optimization.

## Component Parts / Feature Branches

### 1. Retro LED Timer (`feat/retro-timer`)
- Implement the "Premium" seven-segment LED display.
- Add glow effects, visible "off" segments, and industrial button styling.
- Integrate audio/vibration feedback.

### 2. Advanced Visualizations (`feat/data-viz`)
- Multi-firearm accuracy comparison charts.
- Ammo price trend lines.
- Shooting frequency trends (Monthly/Yearly).

### 3. Technical Polish (`feat/app-optimization`)
- Lazy loading for long session histories.
- Database indexing and query optimization for large datasets.
- UI/UX refinements based on "range-testing" feedback (e.g., larger touch targets, high-contrast mode for sun).

## Definition of Done
- Timer looks and feels like a tactical piece of equipment.
- App remains snappy even with 100+ sessions and 1000+ targets.
